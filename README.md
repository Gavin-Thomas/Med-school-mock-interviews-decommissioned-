# Med-school-mock-interviews-decommissioned-
Codebase for Medical School Mock Interviews - Project Decommissioned Due to High Cost of Running. Cost was upwards of $300 per month using the D-ID and OpenAI api, thus due to a lack of reveneue the project was shut down.

Functionalities:
- talk back and forth with a "talking head" which is basically just a figure that you can talk to
- the "talking head" acts as your interviewer and can format and run mock interviews
